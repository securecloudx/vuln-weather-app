4. **Subject**: "Docker Security Challenge - Team [NUMBER] Submission"

### üìã Detailed File Requirements

#### Dockerfile.secure

Your main deliverable - the fixed, secure version of the Dockerfile.

**Must address these vulnerabilities:**

- ‚úÖ Container should NOT run as root
- ‚úÖ Should use production server (not development)
- ‚úÖ Should implement security best practices

**Self-test before submission:**

```bash
# Critical test - MUST PASS
docker build -t my-solution -f Dockerfile.secure .
docker run --rm my-solution whoami
# Expected: NOT "root"

# Functionality test - MUST PASS
docker run -p 8080:5173 my-solution &
curl http://localhost:8080
# Expected: HTML response
```

#### SOLUTION-REPORT.md

**Template:**

````markdown
# Team [NUMBER] - Docker Security Challenge Solution

## Team Information

- **Team Name**:
- **Team Members**:
- **Submission Date**:

## 1. Vulnerabilities Discovered (30 points)

### Vulnerability 1: Root User Execution (HIGH RISK)

- **Location**: Dockerfile lines 4-5 (commented out)
- **Description**: Container runs as root user
- **Risk Level**: Critical
- **Potential Impact**: Container escape, privilege escalation
- **How to Exploit**: [Explain the attack scenario]

### Vulnerability 2: [Your finding]

- **Location**:
- **Description**:
- **Risk Level**:
- **Potential Impact**:
- **How to Exploit**:

[Continue for all vulnerabilities found...]

## 2. Security Fixes Implemented (35 points)

### Fix 1: Non-Root User Implementation

- **What Changed**: Added user creation and USER directive
- **Code Added**:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
      adduser -S nextjs -u 1001 -G nodejs
  USER nextjs
  ```
````

- **Verification**: `docker run --rm my-solution whoami` returns `nextjs`
- **Why This Matters**: Follows principle of least privilege

### Fix 2: [Your next fix]

- **What Changed**:

## 3. Testing and Validation (10 points)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Build the secure image
docker build -t team-[NUMBER]-secure -f Dockerfile.secure .

# Run the application
docker run -p 3000:5173 team-[NUMBER]-secure

# Access at: http://localhost:3000
```

### Security Verification

```bash
# Test 1: Verify non-root user
docker run --rm team-[NUMBER]-secure whoami
# Expected: nextjs (or your chosen non-root user)

# Test 2: Verify production server
docker run --rm team-[NUMBER]-secure ps aux | grep npm
# Expected: Shows "preview" not "dev"

# Test 3: Verify file ownership
docker run --rm team-[NUMBER]-secure ls -la /app | head -5
# Expected: Files owned by non-root user
```

## 4. Advanced Security Measures (Bonus - 10 points)

[Optional: Describe any additional security measures you implemented]

- Multi-stage builds
- Resource limits
- Health checks
- Security scanning
- etc.
